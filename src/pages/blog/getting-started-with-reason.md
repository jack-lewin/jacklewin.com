Over the past few months I've become increasingly interested in Reason, a new JS-like syntax for OCaml, written by Facebook. It's still very new, but is starting to draw some attention â€“ particularly since it was revealed that [Messenger.com is 50% written in Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/blog/2017/09/08/messenger-50-reason.html).

I've taken what I've learnt so far, and written a [ReasonML: Getting Started](https://dev.to/jlewin_/reasonml-getting-started-53gi) guide over at dev.to. I had a Raspberry Pi lying around and figured I might as well try making my own Magic Mirror app with it. That tutorial walks through first stage of this, where I built a simple weather app.

Here's a link to the [source code](https://github.com/jack-lewin/reason-weather-app) for the initial tutorial. Photos to follow, plus details on the process of building the Magic Mirror itself&hellip;
