I also spent too much time scrolling through Twitter (I'm sure I'm not the only one), and not enough time creating. Besides that, I spent too much time staring at screens in general. This is a slightly more difficult issue, because my job involves spending a majority of my day looking at screens and typing away.

I've become much more aware of [attention](https://jon.gold/2018/02/exhaust-ports/) and mindful technology &ndash; something I'd like to explore more in 2019.
