description: Setting an eco-friendly challenge to avoid all single-use plastic.

This month, Laura and I decided to set ourselves an eco-friendly challenge: complete the entire month without using any single-use plastic.

To begin with, this seemed like a not-too-difficult task. Living in London, we have the luxury of having various plastic-free shops in the local area.

However the more we planned, the more we realised how strongly single-use plastic is embedded in our everyday lives: toothpaste, washing and cleaning products, tissues and toilet paper, the list goes on&hellip; The only exception we made was medication because, unfortunately, there aren’t yet any plastic-free alternatives for inhalers or epipens, but they’re both pretty essential.

Some people have asked for tips on how to reduce their plastic consumption, so I've made a note of some of the changes we've made.

In terms of household cleaning, we used our [local refill store](https://www.kclsu.org/nought) to buy all the boring things (cleaning products, washing-up liquid, laundry supplies &ndash; you get the idea). You can get also plastic-free dishwasher tablets from Splosh[^1].

Body wash &amp; shampoo were an easy win: try replacing your plastic bottles with a good old bar of soap and a sponge. I was also unaware that shampoo bars exist &ndash; we tried grüum[^2] and can recommend. One change I was pleasantly surprised by was switching to a natural deodorant stick rather than an aerosol &ndash; I got this and a few other essentials from The Cruelty Free Beauty Box[^3].

My favourite challenge, of course, was food. We're fortunate enough to be near a range of great food markets, but we found that it was actually possible to do a majority of our shopping in supermarkets, thanks to Waitrose's [sustainability efforts](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/shop/featured/groceries/sustainability). We found that we cooked from scratch more, because convenience items are not often available plastic-free. This meant we ate much more healthily this month &ndash; and it actually ended up being cheaper than we expected! We also ate much less meat and dairy than usual. However, I wasn't willing to give up tea &ndash; Milk &amp; More[^4] is an good choice if you'd like your milk delivered in reusable glass bottles. It's probably worth bearing in mind that they don't _exclusively_ use electric vehicles, though, and delivery might be less sustainable if you're not in a densely-populated area. We got some plastic-free toilet paper and tissues delivered, too &ndash; they have a whole [plastic-free section](https://www.milkandmore.co.uk/Lifestyle/c/Plastic-Free) on their website.

The only plastic-free substitute I probably won't continue with is the toothpaste, although I'm open to suggestions! I have nothing against the product (we tried Ben & Anna paste[^3] which is just like what you'd normally use), but it's much more expensive than your regular options &ndash; we shared a &pound;10 jar which lasted the month. We also tried Denttabs, which are little tablets that turn into paste when you chew them. I was amazed by these but they take some getting used to!

<br />

This month has certainly changed the way I think about consumption. Whilst it took some initial planning to make sure we'd found plastic-free alternatives for everything we needed, it became a relatively trivial day-to-day consideration once we'd passed that first hurdle. As with many lifestyle changes, it's purely a case of forming the habit. And it was exactly that: a small lifestyle change.

I encourage you to give it a try!
